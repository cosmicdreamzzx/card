#### Project-1

This project based from UMASSDs "Web Typography" class was all about personal branding and giving us junior designers a chance to get our feet wet in HTML and CSS. My project includes interactive elements, clickable links, and inclusive design elements, to provide an online business ard for my professional an remote needs. Feel free to asset and copy code elements for your own projects, so we can all learn together.

#### Experience-s

During this time I learned a lot very quickly on what goes into designing a website, getting assets together, designing and coding. I used valuable skills such as communicating with classmates, giving feedback, and organizing. 

#### Asset-s

I created my mockups using Adobe Photoshop, Figma, and my good old fashioned pen and paper. I wanted to create a design that was simple enough for a first practice, but also screamed who I was. The design is based around modern day brutalist design with strong colors and dissolving backgrounds. I wanted the feeling of the website to invoke small bits of nostagolia from older website during the y2k and early 2000s.
