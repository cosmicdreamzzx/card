#### Project-1

This project based from UMASSDs "Web Typography" class was all about personal branding and giving us junior designers a chance to get our feet wet in HTML and CSS. My project includes interactive elements, clickable links, and inclusive design elements, to provide an online business card for my professional and remote needs. Feel free to asset and copy code elements for your own projects, so we can all learn together.

#### Experience-s

During this time I learned a lot very quickly on what goes into designing a website like, getting assets together, designing, and coding. I used valuable skills such as communicating with classmates, giving feedback, and organizing to achieve the best possible results. Code has been so easy to learn via Visual Studio Code. I experienced a much easier time having the help of AI tools to provide easy fixing of my code, however  astrong foundation was needed, so I learned with extra lessons on Scrimba and Figma lessons.

#### Asset-s

I created my mockups using Adobe Photoshop, Figma, and my good old fashioned pen and paper. I wanted to create a design that was simple enough for a first practice, but also screamed who I was. The design is based around modern day brutalist design with strong colors and dissolving backgrounds. I wanted the feeling of the website to invoke small bits of nostagolia from older website during the y2k and early 2000s. My work is mainly focused on the youth of our generation, I wish to continue to make design that quenches the thirst for youth who have a more edgy and punk side to them. My designs are for the future, whats popular, and most important what the world needs to hear.
